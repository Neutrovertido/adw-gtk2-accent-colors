# adw-gtk3 GTK2 precolorized theme
To use this project, head to the gtk2 folder and select between the dark and light variants, then select which color you want and finally copy the `gtk-2.0` folder to where your `adw-gtk3` or `adw-gtk3-dark` theme is.  
  
This should also work with QT apps if using qt5ct with the qt5-style-plugins set to `gtk2`
